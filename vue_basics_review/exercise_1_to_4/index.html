    <h4>{{ title }} -> It doesn't work because it is out of the scope of what Vue JS is controlling.</h4>
    <div id="app">
        <h4>{{ title }} -> It works because it is within the scope of the HTML element that is controlled by
            VueJS.</h4>
        <p>{{ greet('morning') }}</p>
        <a href="url">YouTube</a>
        This link doesn't work because it has {{ url }} set as the HREF and HMTL take this value as
        an string because it expects to receive strings for all the HTML attributes.
        <hr />
        <a v-bind:href="url">YouTube</a>
        To avoid this from happening, we need to pass the value as a binded property using the v-bind
        directive, like this: v-bind:href, it could be also used as :href, without the directive name.
        <hr/>
        <div v-bind:class="classes">Classes from instance, even the classes is an array Vue knows that classes must be printed one after the other.</div>
        <hr />
        <input type="text" :value="name">
        v-bind is not a double bind directive
        <hr />
        <input type="text" v-model:value="lastName">
        v-model is a double bind directive

    </div>
